# Detection and Extraction of ML Training Workflows

(work in progress)

A Python-based tool that detects and analyzes Machine Learning training workflows in Python code using both AST-based and LLM-based approaches.

## Currently working on the dataset

The dataset contains 3 levels of Python scripts of ML training workflows:
1. Syntactic Baseline - this contains standard library calls and variable names.
2. Semantic Alias - this contains standard libraries but non-standard naming.
3. Architectural Shift - this has no standard "fit" keyword.
